# Utils Module
## Rules:
- For naming convention: follow these rules:
    - Entities ==> should be like "DFlipFlop"
    - Architecture ==> same as entity with Arch like "DFlipFlopArch"
    - Signals, inputs, outputs, variables are camel cases ==> "myRegister"
    - Rule of Thump ==> Avoid underscores
    - file names the same name of its entity ==> "DFlipFlop.vhd"
    - Constants All Capital letters ==> "MDRIN"
- Commits Convention:
    - [Team][Entity]: Message
    - [CNN][DMA]: fixing bug in syncronization.
- Document your code well (At least provide input output interface describing)
- Common code should be added in Utils folder.
- Every sub team should work on his branch.
- Don't merge on master unless your code is well tested.
- If you have other rules add them :D
